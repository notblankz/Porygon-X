# Porygon-X

Porygon-X is a self-balancing biped robot powered by an ESP32, NEMA17 stepper motors, and an MPU6050 IMU for real-time stability control. It uses a PID control system, which can be tuned live via a web interface.

Designed for stability, precision, and a tech-focused approach, Porygon-X is a fusion of robotics and automation.

**Work in progress â€“ Stay tuned.**
